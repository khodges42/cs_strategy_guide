# Strategy Guide

## Books
[Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programs](https://github.com/sarabander/sicp) is by far the best book I've ever read. There are youtube videos from MIT OpenCourseware of the authors teaching the course. The language itself is very dated, but the concepts are mindblowing even for an experienced programmer.

[Cracking the Code Interview](www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) is excellent for two reasons. One being that it's essentially the strategy guide to pass any code interview, two being that it's a really nice all in one place for reviewing data structures and algorithms.

[Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612) is indispensable for OOP. I hated OOP before familiarizing myself with these concepts. You'll find that reading this (or another book on design patterns) gives you the terminology to discuss designing software.. I would regularly hear stuff like "Do we use an Interface here or a Factory?" and be left scratching my head. This was the solution.

The [Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=BT7N2QV8KVMRDWRE09JE) book is hard mode but contains more or less a bachelors of CS

[Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) written by the guy who founded Agile. I'd recommend it to someone who's comfortable with programming but wants to level up their 'enterprise development' skills. This will take you from 'I can write code' to 'Software Engineer'.

[C book](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-2nd-Brian-Kernighan/dp/0131103628) This is my favorite language specific book hands down. It was written by the guys that made C. It's a million years old and still is the best place you can learn C. Even if you don't plan on using C very much, it's useful to understand since most modern languages touch it in some way.
[Python book](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/) Python the Hard Way is a fun read.
[Java book](https://www.amazon.com/Core-Java-I-Fundamentals-10th/dp/0134177304) If you have to learn Java, this is a book on Java.
[Go book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-go-programming/9780134190570/) Written by one of the guys that wrote the C book (and language lol)

Lifehack- [O'Reilly Safari does free trials for 7 days](https://learning.oreilly.com/accounts/login/) and will have (all?) of these books.


## Talks
Conference Talks are a format in tech (and especially software development) that has grown into an artform. Here are a few favorites.

## General
The role requirements are more or less similar everywhere other than specific language/tool skills. Don't worry too much about specific languages/tools, the places worth going to won't care too much since it's not a big deal to learn C# if you know Java, or Go if you know Rust, etc.

The general (knowledge) requirements look like this:
- Know a Low(ish) Level System language (C, Go, C++, Rust) <= Not necessary for most frontend roles
- Know an OOP Language (Java, C#, C++ to a lesser extent)
- Know a Scripting Language (Python, Bash, Ruby, Perl to a lesser extent)
- Know some web stuff (Node.js) <= Not necessary for most systems/backend roles
- Know Git really, really well
- Understand an OS fairly well (Linux is probably best for this unless you're doing some specific specialty)
- Understand code architecture and clean code (read Clean Code and Design patterns, basically)
- Know your tools, be able to speak to technical decisions
- Networking, Containers, VMs, System Performance, DevOps, Security are all good topics to be able to speak on too.

What is "knowing" a language? Nobody knows! I generally say that I "know" a language when I've built something in it that is actually fairly large and actually useful. It *doesnt* mean that you can write the language without looking things up. We all google/stackoverflow all day long.

I find the best way to demonstrate knowing a language is to have a few projects on github in that language. Your github is oftentimes worth more than your resume, I've gotten 'no thanks' for jobs on the basis that my github was trash. Build a few projects! Fork some stuff. Contribute to Open Source.

Contributing to Open Source is a great way to get some experience. The jobs worth working at will care that you contribute. It's as easy as reading code on github and making small fixes, even spelling and formatting mistakes. I've written documentation for projects. When you do this, it will show on your github that you've contributed, and (depending on the project) you can put these on your resume. There's a talk in the talks section on how to contribute to the Linux Kernel- its fairly easy and the resume bragging rights are worth

Self-Taught folks tend to get killed by whiteboard interview questions, I totally did. These questions are usually biased towards recent college grads and often are unrelated to what you do in your daily job. Reading Cracking the Code Interview and understanding algorithms and data structures will be sufficient to pass most of these. (I read CTCI on the flight to my Riot onsite :smile: )

One other thing I'd recommend is doing some research on tools. I'm a big fan of Emacs, Docker, ZSH and IntelliJ -  those are the things that work for me when writing code. Everybody is different, but mastering your IDE/Editor to the point where you're reflexively able to zip through many files is imperative.
